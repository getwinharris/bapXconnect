The Functions service allows you to create custom behaviour that can be triggered by any supported bapXdb system events or by a predefined schedule.

bapXdb Cloud Functions lets you automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by bapXdb or by setting it to be executed in a predefined schedule. Your code is stored in a secure way on your bapXdb instance and is executed in an isolated environment.
